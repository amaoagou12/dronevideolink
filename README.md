Video / control link for drone and other business

The aim of this project is to build an open source video and control link for drone with the quality as an industrial leader. Now the best known video link for drone is around 7km under FCC when tested with line of sight environment. Our objective is that under FCC regulation we can create an robust video link in 10KM and close to 20KM when testing in line of sight environment.
